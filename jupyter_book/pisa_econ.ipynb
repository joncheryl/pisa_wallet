    "# PISA as a Predictor of Economic and Institutional Performance\n",
    "How well do PISA scores (as compared to lost wallet reporting rates) explain variation in economic development?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four measures of \"Economic and Institutional Performance\" in the second part of the paper: GDP per capita (log_gdp), productivity(log_tfp), government effectiveness (gee), and letter grade efficiency (letter_grading). If PISA scores are considered a fifth measure of the same sort, we find that wallet reporting rates are an even more effective predictor. When combined with any other measure of social capital, the coefficient for wallet reporting rates are always statistically significant with p<0.01 and with R^2 greater than most of the other fit models. In fact, I suspect that for the single variable models (PISA ~ wallet_rate + C), that the R^2 is greater than for any of the other measures. I'm not sure why those regression results aren't in the paper.\n",
