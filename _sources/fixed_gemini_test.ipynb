    "# Summary and Concluding Thoughts:\n",
    "\n",
    "This integrated analysis confirms several key points and reveals interesting connections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Wallet Return Rates as a Measure of Social Capital:** The EDA and correlations support the idea that wallet return rates are a valid behavioral measure related to social capital, aligning with survey-based measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **PISA Scores and Social Capital:** PISA educational achievement scores show a surprisingly strong positive correlation with country-level wallet return rates. This suggests that factors contributing to higher educational outcomes may overlap significantly with those fostering civic honesty and broader social capital. The correlation (around 0.78) is notable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Predictive Power:**\n",
    "    * At the **country level**, wallet return rates (and PISA scores) show predictive power for various economic and institutional indicators (as explored by Tannenbaum and extended here with PISA in regressions).\n",
    "    * At the **individual level**, predicting whether a specific person will return a wallet based on the available features (even including PISA scores as a country-level proxy) remains difficult, with model accuracies around 68-70%. This highlights the difference between aggregate societal trends and individual behavior prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Feature Importance (Implicit):** While not explicitly detailed with feature importance plots from the ML models in this combined notebook, the varying correlations in the association matrix and the regression coefficients hint at which factors are more strongly related to wallet returns and PISA scores. For instance, `general_morality` and `general_trust` often show some of the higher correlations among survey measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both honesty and education are challenging to influence directly through policy. The strong correlation might suggest that familial and community factors (components of social capital) are highly influential for educational outcomes. or...\n",
    "- Both honesty and education are hard to influence but it's practically impossible for governments to move the needle on honesty. This gives credence to the notion that families and communities are what really influence educational outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{danger}\n",
    "Throwing caution to the wind and jumping to conclusions in haste: this shows that increasing the performance of education systems necessarily requires improving civic honesty. Since it is unlikely that neither civic honesty nor educational success cause the other, it stands to reason that educational success is ultimately a function of social capital which is easy to suspect as the causative factor.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "**Further Exploration Ideas:**\n",
    "* **Interaction Effects:** Explore interaction terms in regression models (e.g., does the relationship between a survey measure and PISA scores change depending on the level of wallet return rates in a country?).\n",
    "* **Clustering:** Could countries be clustered based on their profiles of wallet returns, PISA scores, and survey measures? This might reveal different typologies of social capital and development.\n",
    "* **Longitudinal Analysis:** The wallet data is not longitudinal but it could be of interest to explore how changes in PISA scores and other measures correlate over time within countries.\n",
    "* **Qualitative Insights:** The quantitative data could be supplemented with qualitative case studies of countries that are outliers (e.g., high PISA but lower wallet returns, or vice-versa) to understand contextual factors.\n",
    "* **Advanced ML Feature Importance:** For the ML models, using techniques like SHAP values or permutation importance could provide clearer insights into which features are most predictive of individual wallet returns, even if overall accuracy is modest."
